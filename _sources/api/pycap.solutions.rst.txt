Solutions
---------

Python modules for computing analytical solutions for drawdown and depletion for
a pumping well near a stream.  Multiple solutions for both drawdown and depletion
are included. Some solutions assume a single aquifer and others account for streambed
resistance or two aquifers vertically separated by an aquitard.
